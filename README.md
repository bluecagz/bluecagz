## ðŸš€ Upcoming Projects

Over the next few months, Iâ€™ll be focusing on the following open-source initiatives, showcasing my **Rust**, **data engineering**, and **protocol development** expertise while contributing to the broader blockchain community:

1. **Blockchain Ingestion**  
   A scalable pipeline designed to ingest on-chain data into PostgreSQL using core schemas for blocks, transactions, and events. It will be easily extensible to accommodate additional chains and custom data structures.

2. **RAG Crypto App**  
   An interactive chatbot that provides insights into crypto transaction activity. Users can query on-chain behaviors to make more informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of blockchain dynamics.

3. **Data Feed Smart Contract**  
   A specialized smart contract aggregator that consolidates critical RPC data from the blockchain ingestion/indexing service. This on-chain data feed aims to improve transparency and accessibility for various blockchain-based applications.

These projects will highlight my skills in **Rust**, **data engineering**, and **protocol development** while contributing to the broader open-source blockchain community.
