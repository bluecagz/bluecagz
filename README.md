# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub Profile

I'm a **Senior Data Engineer** with a focus on **blockchain data platforms** and **protocol-level engineering**. Currently working at a leading blockchain company, I specialize in developing scalable, data-driven solutions for blockchain infrastructure and have extensive experience with modern data technologies.

---

## ðŸ”­ Current Focus
- **Blockchain Protocols in Rust**: Exploring Rust to build efficient, reliable blockchain protocols with an emphasis on high-performance, secure systems.
- **Data Platforms and Infrastructure**: Building and optimizing data platforms to support advanced blockchain analytics, governance, and data-driven decision-making.

---

## ðŸŒ± Learning Goals
As an active member of the blockchain community, Iâ€™m eager to deepen my expertise in Rust and blockchain development. My primary areas of focus include:
- **Protocol Development**: Understanding and implementing the architecture of various chains, including **Solana**, **Aptos**, **SUI**, **Stellar**, and more.
- **Real-Time Data Platforms**: Creating high-performance platforms that seamlessly integrate and process blockchain data in real time.

## ðŸš€ Future Projects
Over the next few months, Iâ€™ll be working on the following open-source projects:

1. **Solana Protocol Sandbox**  
   Experimenting with Rust-based protocols, delving into Solanaâ€™s architecture, and exploring smart contract design for secure and scalable dApps.

2. **GRPC Blockchain Library**  
   Developing a **gRPC library and client** optimized for large-scale interactions with blockchain data, enabling efficient and robust data retrieval and processing.

3. **Blockchain Indexer**  
   Building a scalable, resilient application for ingesting, indexing, and analyzing blockchain data in near real-time to facilitate high-quality analytics and insights.

These projects will highlight my skills in **Rust**, **data engineering**, and **protocol development** while contributing to the broader open-source blockchain community.
